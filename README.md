**Project Overview**
This churn analysis explores customer retention patterns to identify key drivers of churn and inform retention strategies.

**Objective**
Compare characteristics of churned vs. retained customers

Identify behavior and service factors linked to churn

Lay groundwork for a predictive churn model

**Data Summary**
Customer attributes: Age, Tariff Plan, Subscription Length, Usage metrics, Churn status

Derived fields: Age Range, Churn Rate by Age Group

**Key Insights**
Customers with shorter subscriptions and lower usage tend to churn more

Lower charges and fewer service interactions correlate with churn

Older customers (51+) show higher churn rates

Churned users spend and engage less

Pay-as-you-go customers are more likely to churn than contractual plans

**Recommendations**
Offer loyalty programs or discounts to high-risk, short-term customers

Promote bundled/value-added services to boost engagement

Tailor retention strategies by age group, especially older users

Segment customers by tenure and usage to personalize retention efforts

**Impact**
This analysis highlights behavior differences and supports building a predictive model to target customers at risk of churn.
